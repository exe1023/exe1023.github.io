My name is Yi-Ting Yeh (葉奕廷) from Taiwan, a master student in Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.
Now I work with [Jeffrey Bigham](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/) and [Maxine Eskenazi](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~max/) on dialog systems.
Previously, I worked with [Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on various research topics about natural language processing with machine learning such as question answering, natural language generation and dialogue systems.

I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University.
I was an intern at [Yahoo!](https://tw.yahoo.com/), and [Taiwan AI Labs](https://ailabs.tw/).
