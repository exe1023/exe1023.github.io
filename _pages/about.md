My name is Yi-Ting Yeh (葉奕廷). 
I am currently a second-year master student working with [Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University.
I am interested in various research topics about Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and dialogue systems.

I received my B.S. from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University.
Previously, I was an intern at [Yahoo!](https://tw.yahoo.com/), and [Taiwan AI Labs](https://ailabs.tw/).
