Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical  component  in  spoken  dialogue  systems.

Classic NLG can be divided into two phases:

1.  sentence planning: deciding on the overallsentence structure 
2.  surface realization: de-termining  specific  word  forms  and  flatteningthe sentence structure into a string. 

Many sim-ple NLG models are based on recurrent neu-ral networks (RNN) and sequence-to-sequence(seq2seq) model, which basically contains anencoder-decoder structure; these NLG modelsgenerate sentences from scratch by jointly op-timizing  sentence  planning  and  surface  real-ization using a simple cross entropy loss train-ing  criterion.

However,  the  simple  encoder-decoder architecture usually suffers from gen-erating complex and long sentences,  becausethe decoder has to learn all grammar and diction  knowledge.   

This  paper  introduces  a  hierarchical decoding NLG model based on linguistic patterns in different levels, and showsthat the proposed method outperforms the tra-ditional one with a smaller model size.   Fur-thermore, the design of the hierarchical decod-ing is flexible and easily-extensible in various NLG systems
